In the given problem, an input of how many words that are taken as input is given. Next that many number of words are given.

Our task is to calculate total amount of unique words and next, we need to calculate the total occurances of each word.

Here since we need the find unique words, dictionaries are used. On looping through each word, we check if the word exists, if it does, we increment
by one. If it doesn't, we just assign 1 as value.
In the the end, print out the length of dictionary for finding out the total unique words.

n = int(input())
dict = {}
for i in range(n):
    word = input()
    if word not in dict:
        dict[word] = 1  # to find total occurances
    else:
        dict[word] += 1
print(len(dict))
for i in dict:
    print(dict[i], end=" ")
